/**
 * This class must be the unique i18n key for an operation read from the database, because its internal state can change,
 * that's why equals() and hashCode() are not implemented. If there was another i18n key instance for the same operation,
 * then we wouldn't be sure which one is hold by the I18n provider, and updating the state of such instance will have no
 * effect if it's not the one hold by the I18n provider. So if the same operation is registered twice (which happens with
 * the cached query), a new instance of this class must be created for the second registration.
 *
 * Its internal state has 2 purposes:
 * 1) holding the "final" i18n key which may be known at the time of its creation (i18nCode from DB can be null), in
 *    which case it is set later when instantiating an operation request.
 * 2) holding the latest operation request which may hold an entity (if the operation is acting on an entity). In that
 *    case, ModalityI18nProvider will be able to interpret an expression to evaluate on that entity.
