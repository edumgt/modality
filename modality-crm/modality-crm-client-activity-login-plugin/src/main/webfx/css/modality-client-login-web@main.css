/* Montserrat password dots are tiny! So we use another font for passwords, but we don't want that font for the placeholder!
   So we apply that font only once the user started typing the password. This is done using :not([value=""]) CSS
   selector. Normally "value" refers to the initial value of the input only. However HtmlTextInputControlPeer keeps
   updating "value" to "" or "not-empty" whether the user has typed something, so this CSS rule finally works: */

    font-family: "Password", serif;

    font-family: "Password";
